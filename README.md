# Quests

The Quests System is an important feature that facilitates users to explore the world, unlock achievements and potentially receive rewards. A quest is a series of steps or tasks that a user has to complete. Each step or task has an acceptance criteria to consider it as done. A quest designer has to define the steps and the order or the path to the end, so the quest is finished when those steps are completed.
